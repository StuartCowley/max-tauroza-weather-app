# Weather App :sunny: :zap: :rainbow: :cloud_with_rain: :tornado:

## Description

A Weather UI built using React, which can be used to view a 5 day weather forecast for a specified location, as well as a detailed forecast for any selected day.

## Purpose

To allow me to gain an understanding of React, building an app out of components, using state and event handlers and accessing external data in a React app.

## Tech that was used

- React
- Axios

## Why this tech?

I used React because it is scalable and renders quickly and Axios because it automatically transforms responses to JSON data;

## Dependencies

Jest, React, React Testing Library and Axios

# Dev dependencies

Eslint, Prettier

## How to install and run the Music Library

- Fork and clone this repository
- Open the cloned directory and run `npm install`

## How to use it

Use the script `npm start` to run the app in development mode. Click on any of the 'More details' buttons to view the detailed forecast for that day. Search for a different town or city in the search bar.

## Credits

I used the create-react-app npx script to set up the basic scaffolding of the project; the Command Shift track and all of the tutors helped me along the way, as well as some of the other students in my cohort.
